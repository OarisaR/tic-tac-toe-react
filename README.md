2. Click on any cell in the grid to make your move.
3. The computer will respond with its move immediately after yours.
4. The game automatically announces the winner or a draw at the end of the match.
5. Click the "Reset" button to restart the game whenever you like.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library used for building the interactive game interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic and dynamic functionality.
- **CSS**: Adds styling and layout to create a visually appealing game board.

## Concepts Applied

This project leverages several key React concepts:

- **Components**: The game is organized into modular, reusable components like `Board`, `Square`, and `Header` for clean architecture.
- **State Management**: React's `useState` hook is used to manage the game's state, including the board layout, current player, and winner status.
- **Event Handling**: User interactions, such as clicking on a cell, trigger updates to the game state dynamically.
- **Conditional Rendering**: React conditionally renders the game status (e.g., "Player Wins!" or "It's a Tie!") based on the current state.
- **Props**: Data is passed between components using props, ensuring separation of concerns.
- **Effect Hook**: The computer's move logic is implemented using React's `useEffect` to handle side effects effectively.
